#+title: Delhi NCR Events

An Events aggregator for events in the Delhi NCR

The ideas is to provide an aggregation of events that are interesting to me (or
other tech enthusiasts).

The aggregation currently only pulls from a handful of Meetup groups, but we
could potentially add more sources for aggregation.

The app is also an experiment in trying Reason based UI along with an OCaml
"backend" -- we use OCaml to generate the RSS and the Calendar file.

* TODO TODO
- Use ~server-reason-react~ in the generated static html?
- Search by title
- Search by group/organizer
